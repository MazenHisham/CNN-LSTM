# CNN-LSTM

What problem does the code solve?

âœ… CNN solves:
Pattern recognition in financial charts (extracts stock market trends).
Detects trends, breakouts, resistance/support zones in stock price movements.

âœ… LSTM solves:
Time-series forecasting problem (predicts the next price based on previous trends).
Handles long-term dependencies in stock price sequences.

Final Output of the Model.
ðŸ“ˆ Predicts the next dayâ€™s closing stock price based on historical chart patterns.

Alternative Approach?
Instead of financial charts (images), you could feed raw stock prices into LSTM alone.
ðŸ”¹ Pros of CNN-LSTM: More advanced, learns from visual patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Pros of LSTM-only: Simpler, but may miss complex chart patterns.
