# CNN-LSTM

Problem Solved by this Code?
✅ CNN solves:

Pattern recognition in financial charts (extracts stock market trends).

Detects trends, breakouts, resistance/support zones in stock price movements.

✅ LSTM solves:

Time-series forecasting problem (predicts the next price based on previous trends).

Handles long-term dependencies in stock price sequences.

Final Output of this Model?
📈 Predicts the next day’s closing stock price based on historical chart patterns.

Alternative Approach?
Instead of financial charts (images), you could feed raw stock prices into LSTM alone.
🔹 Pros of CNN-LSTM: More advanced, learns from visual patterns.
🔹 Pros of LSTM-only: Simpler, but may miss complex chart patterns.
