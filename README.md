# CNN-LSTM

Overview:
This project aims to predict Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) stock closing prices using a hybrid LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. Stock prediction is challenging due to market volatility, but deep learning methods can help identify patterns in historical data.

Data:
The dataset contains historical stock prices for Apple, including features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. The data was preprocessed by removing dollar signs, converting price columns to float, and normalizing the values using Min-Max scaling.
Final Output of the Model.

ðŸ“ˆ Predicts the next dayâ€™s closing stock price based on historical chart patterns.
